* Hauler: Aisles of Glory Automation
A simple shell script that opens a browser, plays through the ``[[https://aislesofglory.nofrills.ca/][Hauler: Aisles of Glory]]'' game, and enters one's PC Optimum card number.

Depends on ~xdotool~ and a browser of choice.

Tested on Linux with the [[https://www.falkon.org/][Falkon]] browser in KDE Plasma 5 on X.org.

Created as a way to learn some basic ~xdotool~ functionality.
