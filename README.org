* Hauler: Aisles of Glory Automation
A simple shell script that opens a browser, plays through the ``Hauler: Aisles of Glory'' game, and enters one's PC Optimum card number.

Depends on `xdotool` and a browser of choice.

Tested on Linux with the Falkon browser in KDE Plasma 5 on X.org.

Created as a way to learn some basic `xdotool` functionality.
